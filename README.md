# Amazon++

This is our vocational school project "Amazon++", a basic online shop in which users can list and buy items.

## Getting Started
### Frontend & Backend
Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/stiangglanda/OnlineShop.git`.
Inside the `code` directory are two node projects, one serving as the frontend and the other as the backend.
Open a terminal for both of the projects and in each run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

### Database
You will also need a MySQL database to use this website effectively. Define the connection information in our [.env.example](https://github.com/stiangglanda/OnlineShop/blob/main/code/Backend/.env.example) file and rename it to `.env`.

## Starting things up
To start either of the projects, run `npm run start`. Alternatively you can also run `npm run dev` to restart the project every time you make changes to it.
